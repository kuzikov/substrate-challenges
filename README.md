In a very short time, having completed the tasks, I learned how to create, configure and run my own nodes based on the Substratum framework. Profiling and debugging a running node and finding memory usage problems. Receive and visualize metrics using Prometheus and Grafan. Build decentralized blockchain applications on the chain. And also to develop a substrate and ERC-20 smart contracts using ink! utility. It was an incredible and smooth development experience. I have not encountered a single significant problem that would distract me from the development process. Very impressive!
